First, download and install the project's dependencies: 

```sh
    git clone https://github.com/kevinEliezer/TheCRMService
    npm i
```

Once installed, you can start messing around! Here are some scripts which will be helpful to you:

-   `start`: build the project and execute it for production. Be sure to define the [.env file](env/README.md) first!
-   `clean`: clean cache and dependencies.
-   `lint`: detect code formats errors.
-   `lint:fix`: detect code formats errors and fixes them.
-   `build:dev`: build and execute the project with a watcher for development purposes.
-   `build:prod`: build the project for production.

To run any of them, just:

```sh
    npm run <script_name>
```
